The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by
criminology investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as
evidence, if it is correctly identified.

In this classification problem we predicted different types of glass based on their
refractive index and the oxide content that is present in the glass.

In this classfication problem we used six classification models to predict the types of glass. And We also compared their suitibility.
The classfication Models are:

i)Logistic Regression Classification Model
ii)KNN (k-nearest neighbors) Classification Model
iii)Support Vector Classification Model
iv)Naive Byes Classification Model
v)Decision Tree Classification Model
vi)Random Forest Classification Model
